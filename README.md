# Huffman-Encoding
In this project, I implemented Huffman algorithm to encode English characters from an input file ("inputFileName.txt"). It will read and print encoded outcome in an output file ("outputFileName.txt") containing the characters "0" and "1".

The program also prints out the frequency and encoded string (in "Encodings_and_Savings") according to each character in the input file. The space savings also included in the file.
